                <p>I find it relieving to put out content that spews out my personaity in some form or fashion.
                    However, I don't really enjoy the way mainstream media and forums portrays our lives through a very thin lens of 
                    only a picture and a small description. Idk, I don't dislike the format but it does feel more daunting to me.(In fact,
                    it can actually be quite useful for more progressional ideas such as projects, ideas, and stories.)

                So why the "most" blank layout ever?

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Well, I just think simple is best. I like thinking of this website as a 'blank canvas' feel. It focuses more on ideas for me 
                    to place on this page rather than just designing it. In the end, I don't think about it too much, so there is absolutely no 
                    good reason why its blank. I'll eventually to get an actual design eventually.

                <p>Honestly, don't expect too much. The point of this website is really not for content to consume.
                    You can choose to check this website from time to time, and you may see changes and updates I make to this page.
                    Or you can just choose not to never check this page again. The point of this website is for me to throw out any
                    ideas or thoughts I pick up from news, hobbies, or life updates. Hell, I will most likely post links of favorite videos or people that 
                    I follow just for the fun. There is nothing here that benefits you. If you just want to check up on me for updates. Well,
                    here you go. I forgot what the selling point should be here.
